# SEO_backlink_analyzer


###### Crawl all the backlinks present in your website and make analysis behind them, a SEO approach

###### The python notebook BacklinksAnalyzer.ipynb provide following functions to work with,

####### Is it a dofollow backlink ?
####### Is it within the body of the page ? (Link location)
####### Is it from a high-quality website ? we can use open pr for this!
####### IP address
####### Number of external links
####### Check if the page has many backlinks
####### How "far away" is the linking domain from Googleâ€™s trusted seed sites (I used the rank of website in commoncrawl web graph to estimate this )
####### Check if IP address from spam-heavy countries
